## Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

![TODO: Update the path with the name of your diagram](Images/diagram_filename.png)

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the _____ file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

  - _TODO: Enter the playbook file._

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly Available, in addition to restricting access to the network.
- _TODO: What aspect of security do load balancers protect? What is the advantage of a jump box?_
		. Load Balancers are used to help with DDos attacks by "load balancing", spreading traffic across the virtual environment.
		. The advantage of a jump box is a user can access the jump box, and with the right credentials can access all of the virtual machines on the the network. The jump box serves as a gateway to the rest of the network, ensuring that the vm's are not open to the public.

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the Network Logs and system traffic.
- _TODO: What does Filebeat watch for?_ Filebeat monitors log files for changes and log events.
- _TODO: What does Metricbeat record?_  MetricBeat collects metrics for the system and anything that is running on the ELK server.

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.

| Name     | Function     | IP Address | Operating System |
|----------|----------    |------------|------------------|
| Jump Box | Gateway      | 10.1.0.4   | Linux            |
| DVWA 1   | VM1 - server | 10.1.0.5   | Linux            |
| DVWA 2   | VM2 - server | 10.1.0.6   | Linux            |
| ELK-VM   | Kibana server| 10.0.0.4   | Linux            |

### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the Jumpbox machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:
- _TODO: Add whitelisted IP addresses_
	75.71.221.108

Machines within the network can only be accessed by Jumpbox.
- _TODO: Which machine did you allow to access your ELK VM? What was its IP address?_
	 My IP address - 75.71.221.108

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name     | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Jump Box | Yes                 | 75.71.221.108        |
| DVWA 1   | no                  | 10.1.0.4             |
| DVWA 2   | no                  | 10.1.0.4             |
  ELK-VM   | no                  | 10.1.0.4             |
### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because...
- _TODO: What is the main advantage of automating configuration with Ansible?_
	The Main Advantage of automating configuration with ansible is after the first vm is created it is easy to create and deploy similar vm's on the network because of the use of playbooks.

The playbook implements the following tasks:
- _TODO: In 3-5 bullets, explain the steps of the ELK installation play. E.g., install Docker; download image; etc._
- . Install docker.io
- . Install python-pip
- . Install docker
- . Command: sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=26144
- . Launch docker container:elk

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
- _TODO: List the IP addresses of the machines you are monitoring_
	10.1.0.5 , 10.1.0.6 , 10.0.0.4

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
- _TODO: Specify which Beats you successfully installed_
	Filebeat , Metricbeat
	

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
- _TODO: In 1-2 sentences, explain what kind of data each beat collects, and provide 1 example of what you expect to see. E.g., `Winlogbeat` collects Windows logs, which we use to track user logon events, etc._

		. Filebeat collects any changes made to the logs or any log files
	. Metricbeat will collect the metrics & statistics - ie the number of times a certain connection was made to and from an IP address.
### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the activityone.yml file to /etc/ansible.
- Update the hosts file to include my computer as a remote user
- Run the playbook, and navigate to http://40.122.70.171:5601/app/kibana#/home to check that the installation worked as expected.

_TODO: Answer the following questions to fill in the blanks:_
- _Which file is the playbook? Where do you copy it?_ activityone.yml is the playbook.  Copy it to /etc/ansible on the attached ansible container so it can be run.
- _Which file do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine? You must specify in the config file. How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on? Inside of the hosts config file i must specify which vm is part of the webservers group or ELK group
- _Which URL do you navigate to in order to check that the ELK server is running?  http://40.122.70.171:5601/app/kibana#/home

_As a **Bonus**, provide the specific commands the user will need to run to download the playbook, update the files, etc._
